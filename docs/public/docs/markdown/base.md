## Typography

### Links

As easy as this:

```HTML
<a href="#">Link</a>
```

If you would like to make something look like a link:

```HTML
<button class="link">Not a link, but it looks like a link.</button>
```

### Pre, code

`pre` and `code` are automatically formatted.

```HTML
<p>This is <code>code</code>!</p>
<pre><code>alert(1)</code></pre>
```
