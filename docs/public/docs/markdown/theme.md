# Theme

If you use SASS, you can change SASS variables how you fancy to get a new theme.
Otherwise, you also could change CSS variables, but they are more limited.

## Colors

- **Canvas** is the color of website background.

- **Primary** is the main matching color of the website.

- **Secondary** is the second main color of the website.

Color variables in SASS:

```SASS
$colors: ( "canvas": ..., "primary": ..., "secondary": ...)
```

Color variables in CSS:

```CSS
:root {
  --canvas-color: ...;
  --primary-color: ...;
  --secondary-color: ...;
}
```
